<summary> Abstract </summary>
<p>This book examines congressional representation in the Jim Crow South in the decades following the New Deal. Marshaling a combination of qualitative and qualitative evidence, I dispute the conventional wisdom that lack of partisan competition destroyed the electoral connection between Southern members of Congress (MCs) and their constituents. I show that although Black Southerners were almost totally disenfranchised, the class-biased exclusion of White Southerners (through devices such as the poll tax) was both less extensive and, given sufficient motivation and mobilization, more easily overcome. Furthermore, while the South did lack partisan competition, the so-called White primary offered meaningful opportunities for electoral competition within the one-party system. The consequence, I argue, was that Southern MCs' responsiveness to their enfranchised (i.e., White) constituents was not noticeably weaker than their non-Southern counterparts.</p>

<p>These conclusions have major historical as well as theoretical implications. From the standpoint of historical interpretation, they provide an alternative explanation for Southern MCs' rapid turn to the right in the late 1930s, which set sharp limits on the scope of New Deal reform. This conservative reaction was driven less by incentives internal to Congress than by a broad-based reaction in the Southern White public. More generally, my findings suggest that Southern MCs were neither autonomous agents nor pliant tools of the economic elite, but rather electorally motivated politicians operating within a regime that mixed racist and authoritarian features with inclusive and democratic ones. The theoretical implications of these conclusions are broad in scope, not least because many regimes around the world have a similar hybrid character. The example of the one-party South suggests that public opinion can and does play an major role in such regimes, but in ways that may be heavily conditioned by institutional context. In particular, intraparty competition can be sufficient to incentivize responsiveness to constituent preferences, but only where non-party informational cues are available, as they were in congressional but not state-level Southern politics.</p>

<summary> Abstract </summary>
Recent research has challenged the policy bases of the New Deal realignment, arguing that it was instead driven by retrospective evaluations of the economy. Using a comprehensive analysis of opinion polls conducted in 1936–52, we argue that policy preferences were far from irrelevant. At the individual level, presidential Republicans who became Democrats were much more supportive of New Deal policies than those who remained loyal (vice versa for Democrats). At the state level, both public support for the New Deal—as measured by a group-level item response model—and income growth predict pro-Democratic shifts in presidential elections. In short, the realignment was rooted in both policy preferences and economic retrospection. Moreover, mass support for the New Deal, unlike partisan identification, was a leading indicator of long-term electoral trends, predicting presidential elections decades in the future even better than it does contemporaneous elections.

<summary> Abstract </summary>
The seemingly wide opening for liberal domestic policy innovation by the U.S. federal government in the early-to-mid-1930s gave way to a much more limited agenda in the late 1930s and 1940s. The latter years saw the consolidation and gradual extension of several key programs (e.g., Social Security and Keynesian macroeconomic management), but also the frustration of liberal hopes for an expansive “cradle-to-grave” welfare state marked by strong national unions, national health insurance, and full employment policies. Drawing upon rarely used early public opinion polls, we explore the dynamics of public opinion regarding New Deal liberalism during this pivotal era. We argue that a broadly based reaction against labor unions created a difficult backdrop for liberal programmatic advances. We find that this anti-labor reaction was especially virulent in the South but divided even Northern Democrats, thus creating an effective wedge issue for Republicans and their Southern conservative allies. More generally, we find that the mass public favored most of the specific programs created by the New Deal, but was hardly clamoring for major expansions of the national government's role in the late 1930s and 1940s. These findings illuminate the role played by the South in constraining New Deal liberalism while also highlighting the tenuousness of the liberal majority in the North.
