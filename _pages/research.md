My first book, *The Unsolid South*, examines congressional representation in the Jim Crow South in the decades following the New Deal. It argued that despite the region's lack of partisan competition and restricted electorate, its representatives were much more responsive to the White mass public than commonly thought. Among other things, I support this claim using dynamic measures of state-level support for the New Deal derived from hundreds of early public opinion polls.

My second book, *Dynamic Democracy*, is a culmination of my long-running (and
still ongoing!) collaboration with Christopher Warshaw on public opinion,
political parties, and policymkaing in the American states. This book offers a
holistic, birds-eye view of state politics between the 1930s and 2010s, with an
emphasis on the dynamic relationship between mass policy preferences and state
policies. We argue that while the quality of state-level democracy is uneven and
responsivenes can be painfully slow, over the long run public opinion exerts a
powerful influence over policymaking.
