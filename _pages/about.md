I am an associate professor of political science at MIT, where I have taught since 2012. Before that I studied at Yale (BA), Clare College, Cambridge (MPhil), and UC Berkeley (PhD).

Most of my research focuses on American politics, but I have also published on comparative politics, international relations, and political methodolgy. I am particularly interested in how representation and accountability have evolved over the course of American history, and I often use a combination of Bayesian measurement models and causal inference methods to study these questions.

Among my current responsibilities are co-editing *The Forum: A Journal of Applied Research in Contemporary Politics*, serving on the board of the Consortium on the American Political Economy, and chairing PhD admissions for the MIT political science department.
