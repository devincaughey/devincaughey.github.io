I am the Class of 1949 Professor of [Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu)
and faculty affiliate of the [Institute for Data, Systems, and
Society](https://idss.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](https://www.mit.edu). Before joining MIT in 2012, I studied at Yale
(History BA), Clare College, Cambridge (History MPhil), and UC Berkeley
(Political Science PhD).

Most of my [research](https://devincaughey.github.io/research/) focuses on American politics, but I have also published on comparative politics, international relations, and political methodology. I am particularly interested in how representation and accountability have evolved over the course of American history, and I often use a combination of Bayesian measurement models and causal inference methods to study these questions.

Among my current responsibilities are serving as my department's Director of
[Graduate Studies](https://polisci.mit.edu/graduate/phd), co-editing [*The
Forum: A Journal of Applied Research in Contemporary
Politics*](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/for/html), and serving on the
board of the [Consortium on the American Political
Economy](https://www.americanpoliticaleconomy.org).

I pronounce my surname so that it rhymes with "doughy" (IPA: 'ko äi).
