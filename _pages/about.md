I am an associate professor of [political science at MIT](https://polisci.mit.edu), where I have taught since 2012. Before that I studied at Yale (History BA), Clare College, Cambridge (History MPhil), and UC Berkeley (Political Science PhD).

Most of my [research](https://devincaughey.github.io/research/) focuses on American politics, but I have also published on comparative politics, international relations, and political methodology. I am particularly interested in how representation and accountability have evolved over the course of American history, and I often use a combination of Bayesian measurement models and causal inference methods to study these questions.

Among my current responsibilities are co-editing [*The Forum: A Journal of Applied Research in Contemporary Politics*](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/for/html), serving on the board of the [Consortium on the American Political Economy](https://www.americanpoliticaleconomy.org), and chairing PhD admissions for the MIT political science department.
